"""
    AUTHORS' SCOPE:
        We thought that the source code of Jarvis would
        be more organized if we treat Jarvis as Object.
        So we decided to create this Jarvis Class which
        implements the core functionality of Jarvis in a
        simpler way than the original __main__.py.
    HOW TO EXTEND JARVIS:
        In progress..
    DETECTED ISSUES:
        * Furthermore, "near me" command is unable to find
        the actual location of our laptops.
